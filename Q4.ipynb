Arya will start by selecting either the number at the beginning (`nums[0]`) or the end (`nums[nums.length - 1]`) of the array, adding that value to her score. This value is then removed from the beginning or the end of `nums`. Then, it’s Mario’s turn to do the same with the remaining sequence. The game proceeds this way, with each player taking numbers from either end until no numbers are left to claim. The player with the highest score wins.\n",

    "The recursive algorithm `opt_strategy_recursive` has an exponential time complexity because it evaluates all possible outcomes of the game for every combination of starting and ending indices. At each step, the algorithm gives the current player two choices: to pick the number at the start of the sequence or the number at the end. After making a choice, the algorithm recursively calculates the optimal strategy for the opponent using the remaining subarray. This creates a binary tree of recursive calls, where each level represents decisions for progressively smaller subarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to exponential complexity, imagine the input array `nums` contains `n` elements. The first call to `opt_strategy_recursive` spans the entire array, from index `0` to `n-1`. At this stage, the current player has two options: pick the first element or the last. For each choice, the algorithm makes a recursive call to solve the problem for the subarray of size `n-1`. This pattern continues, with each recursive call generating two new calls for subarrays of size `n-2`, and so forth, until the base case of an empty subarray is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "At every depth in the recursion tree, the number of paths doubles, resulting in \\(2^n\\) calls for an array of size `n`. This exponential growth occurs because the algorithm doesn’t save results for previously solved subproblems. Instead, it recalculates results for overlapping subarrays repeatedly, which leads to a massive increase in computational effort as `n` grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level of recursion, the number of possible paths in the recursion tree doubles. Specifically, at depth `d`, there are `2^d` potential paths. Since the depth of the recursion tree corresponds to the number of elements in the input array, the total number of recursive calls grows exponentially as \\(2^n\\), where `n` is the size of the array. This exponential growth happens because the algorithm doesn’t store the results of subproblems. Instead, it recalculates the same results for overlapping subarrays multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the subproblem where the array spans indices `1` to `n-2`. This subarray can be reached through two different paths in the recursion tree: one where the first element of the original array was selected, and another where the last element was chosen. The algorithm calculates the optimal strategy for the subarray `nums[1:n-2]` independently in both cases, effectively duplicating work. As the size of the array increases, the number of overlapping subproblems grows rapidly, leading to an exponential increase in the time required to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this with code, every time the function `opt_strategy_recursive(nums, start, end, turn)` is called, it can make two additional recursive calls: `opt_strategy_recursive(nums, start + 1, end, ...)` and `opt_strategy_recursive(nums, start, end - 1, ...)`. Without using memoization or caching, these calls are repeated for the same combinations of `start` and `end`, significantly increasing the number of recursive calls. This repetition leads to redundant computations, as the algorithm keeps recalculating solutions for identical subarray ranges instead of reusing previously computed results.\n"
